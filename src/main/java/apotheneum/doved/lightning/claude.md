# Lightning Pattern Algorithm

## Overview
This file describes the algorithm for the Lightning pattern in the Apotheneum installation.

## Algorithm Description

Drawing realistic 2D lightning involves creating a jagged, branching line that simulates the path of a discharge. Several algorithms can achieve this, often incorporating randomness to capture lightning's unpredictable nature.

### 1. Midpoint Displacement Algorithm (Recommended)
This is a popular and relatively simple method:

**Initialization**: Start with a straight line segment between the bolt's origin (e.g., top of the screen) and end point (e.g., bottom of the screen).

**Recursive Displacement**:
- Choose a point (S) on the current line segment, typically near the midpoint
- Displace S randomly perpendicular to the segment by a small amount
- Recursively apply this process to the two new sub-segments created by S (from start to S, and from S to end)
- Continue this recursion until the segments become very small or a desired level of detail is reached

**Branching (Optional)**: To create the realistic branching effect, add a third line segment (a branch) from S with a small random chance during the displacement step.

### 2. L-systems (Lindenmayer Systems)
L-systems offer a powerful way to generate fractal-like structures, including lightning:

- **Define Rules**: Create a set of rules that dictate how a line segment can be replaced with more complex segments and branching structures
- **Apply Recursively**: Apply these rules iteratively to an initial line segment, creating the lightning bolt structure
- **Randomization**: Introduce randomness to the angles and lengths generated by the L-system rules to create a more organic appearance

### 3. Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRT)
This algorithm can also generate interesting lightning patterns:

- **Goal-Oriented Growth**: Instead of a simple recursive midpoint displacement, RRT starts at one end and grows the lightning towards a target point
- **Random Samples**: At each step, a random point near the goal is chosen, and the closest point on the existing lightning structure extends towards that random sample
- **Flexibility**: Modifying how the random points are sampled and how the lightning extends can lead to different lightning styles, including ones that wrap around obstacles

### 4. Physically-Based Algorithm
This algorithm simulates the actual physics of lightning formation, based on the stepped leader and return stroke process:

- **Stepped Leader Simulation**: Models the downward-propagating negative charge channel that branches as it seeks ground connection
- **Electric Field Influence**: Each step is influenced by electric field calculations and charge distribution
- **Natural Branching**: Branches occur based on electric potential and field conditions, not random probability
- **Return Stroke**: Once ground connection is made, bright return strokes travel back up the established channels
- **Charge Decay**: Electric potential decreases along the channel, affecting intensity and branching behavior

#### RRT Algorithm Implementation Details

**Initialization**:
- Create a tree with a single root node at the lightning origin point
- Define a goal region (target area for lightning to reach)
- Set step size for tree growth (segment length)
- Define bias probability for goal-directed sampling

**Core Algorithm Loop**:
1. **Sample Point**: Generate a random point in the search space
   - With probability `goalBias` (e.g., 0.1), sample directly from goal region
   - Otherwise, sample uniformly from the entire space
2. **Find Nearest**: Locate the closest node in the existing tree to the sampled point
3. **Extend**: Create a new node by extending from the nearest node towards the sample
   - Move a fixed step size in the direction of the sample
   - Add random perpendicular displacement for lightning-like jaggedness
4. **Add Node**: Add the new node to the tree if it doesn't violate constraints
5. **Check Goal**: If the new node reaches the goal region, terminate or continue for denser branching

**Branching Strategy**:
- **Natural Branching**: The tree structure inherently creates branches
- **Forced Branching**: With small probability, extend multiple nodes from the same parent
- **Pruning**: Remove branches that haven't grown recently to focus energy on active paths

**Lightning-Specific Adaptations**:
- **Electrical Field Simulation**: Bias sampling towards areas of high "electrical potential"
- **Stepped Leader Model**: Implement stepped progression with pauses and redirections
- **Return Stroke**: Once main path is established, trace back with higher intensity
- **Charge Accumulation**: Model charge buildup that influences subsequent branching

**Advantages for Lightning**:
- Creates naturally branching, tree-like structures
- Goal-oriented growth mimics electrical discharge seeking shortest path
- Can handle complex obstacles and boundaries
- Produces organic, non-repetitive patterns
- Easily parameterized for different lightning styles

**Implementation Parameters**:
- `stepSize`: Distance of each tree extension (affects detail level)
- `goalBias`: Probability of sampling from goal region (0.0-1.0)
- `maxIterations`: Maximum number of tree extensions
- `branchProbability`: Chance of creating multiple branches from one node
- `jaggedness`: Amount of random perpendicular displacement
- `goalRadius`: Size of the target region considered "reached"
- `electricalField`: Function defining charge distribution for biased sampling

### Visual Enhancement Tips

**Jaggedness and Randomness**: Lightning rarely travels in a perfectly straight line, so introduce random deviations and sharp turns to create a natural, chaotic look.

**Branching and Subtlety**: Add thinner, secondary branches that extend from the main strike, mimicking the branching nature of real lightning. These branches can be dimmer or have a more subtle blur than the main strike.

**Corners and Thickness**: The points where the lightning changes direction can be slightly thicker or form sharp angles or even open loops with negative space inside.

**Color and Glow**: Lightning often emits a brilliant, blue-white light. Experiment with colors and add a glowing or blurred effect around the lightning bolt to enhance its visual impact.

**Animation**: Animating the lightning by rapidly changing its shape and intensity can further enhance the realism and visual appeal.
